## Phase status

- [x] Bootstrap — repo scaffold, research corpus, execution script (built in
      Claude cloud session, 2026-08-21)
- [x] Phase 0 — Environment discovery *(cloud container; re-run on the
      physical machine when it joins)*
- [x] Phase 1 — Server core and token kernel *(cloud container, 2026-08-21)*
- [ ] Phase 2 — Blender adapter *(in progress in cloud: headless-testable
      parts; live-GUI validation needs the physical machine)*
- [ ] Phase 3 — Unreal adapter *(requires the physical machine — UE editor
      cannot run in the cloud container)*
- [x] Phase 4 — Cross-cutting friction killers *(cloud, 2026-08-21; doctor
      re-run on the physical machine will extend the evidence)*
- [ ] Phase 5 — Benchmarks *(Blender scenarios done in cloud: 87.7% total
      saving measured — see benchmarks/RESULTS.md; UE scenarios need the
      physical machine)*
- [ ] Phase 6 — Packaging and handoff
- [x] Phase 7 — TEE Extract: media extraction module *(built in cloud,
      2026-08-22: all lanes + store + frames + handoff + IFC export; 144
      non-DCC tests, 26 live-Blender tests, extraction benchmark 92.6%
      saving. Whisper/pyannote model quality on real site audio and
      GPU-dependent paths still deserve a physical-machine spot check)*

## Machine facts

### Cloud build container (Claude Code on the web, 2026-08-21)

- OS: Linux x64 (ephemeral container; work persists only via git push)
- Python: 3.11.15 (default), 3.12, 3.13 available; `uv` installed
- Blender: 5.2.0 LTS extracted at `/home/user/blender-5.2.0-linux-x64/`
  (headless verified: `bpy OK (5, 2, 0) py 3.13.13`); official Blender MCP
  extension NOT installed; no GUI/display
- Unreal: not installed, not installable here (size + EULA + editor GUI)
- MCP Python SDK: 2.0.0 (see DECISIONS 2026-08-21 — `MCPServer` API)
- Adapter tiers: Blender primary (5.2 LTS headless); UE n/a in cloud

### Physical machine

## Evidence log

*(paste real command output here when checking off acceptance criteria)*

### 2026-08-21 — Bootstrap
- Deep-research pass completed (11 agents, ~1.15M tokens): corpus committed
  under `docs/research/` (10 digests + index).
- Execution script authored from the corpus; architecture decisions A1–A7
  recorded in `docs/research/00-index.md`.

### 2026-08-21 — Phase 0 + Phase 1 (cloud)
- `server/` scaffolded with uv; `make check` = ruff + pytest.
- Kernel implemented: adapter contract + fake adapter, differential scene
  cache (epoch/revision stamps, net-diff merging, bounded log), response
  budgeter + per-tool size log, progressive-disclosure registry
  (search/describe/call with argument validation), checkpoint manager with
  auto-checkpoint per batch, async job manager, project memory (.tee/).
- MCP surface: 14 always-loaded tools on `mcp` SDK 2.0 `MCPServer`,
  `structured_output=False` everywhere (A6), inline-JPEG capture tool.
- Evidence: `uv run pytest` → **50 passed** (units + A6 lint suite + 6
  end-to-end in-memory MCP client scenarios); `ruff check` clean.
- Measured: full 14-tool definition surface ≈ **2,307 tokens** (budget 8K;
  wild-average is ~710 tokens/tool, so the whole surface costs ~3 tools).
- `tee serve` (stdio, fake adapter) and `tee doctor` (stub) run.

### 2026-08-21 — Phase 2 (cloud-testable parts) + adversarial review
- Blender adapter over the official Blender Lab MCP add-on wire protocol
  (verified against the real add-on source and live headless Blender 5.2);
  generic batch interpreter (N ops = 1 round-trip), `session_uid` entity
  ids, API firewall over the ten catalogued 4.x/5.x fault lines,
  snapshot/rollback, byte-budgeted JPEG capture, `bl_*` virtual tools.
- TEE bridge add-on (`adapters/blender/tee_bridge/`): same protocol,
  hardened threading (I/O thread + single persistent timers pump / blocking
  background loop), 5.1+ extension manifest, denylist guard. Live suite runs
  against BOTH bridge flavors.
- **Adversarial review workflow** (32 agents, ~2.2M tokens): 28 findings
  confirmed empirically, 0 refuted — including three majors: the mcp 2.0
  SDK dispatches tool calls concurrently on worker threads (torn state), the
  SDK pretty-prints dict returns (≈2x wire size; fixed by returning compact
  JSON strings), and mid-batch failures left the DCC and scene cache
  silently divergent (fixed: batches are atomic — auto-restore to the
  checkpoint on failure). All 28 fixed with regression tests.
- Evidence: `uv run pytest` → **85 passed**; `uv run pytest -m dcc` →
  **20 passed** (both bridge flavors, real Blender 5.2); ruff clean.
- Follow-up for next session: adversarial review round over the fix diff +
  bridge add-on; GUI-mode bridge validation needs the physical machine.

### 2026-08-21 — Phase 4 (cloud)
- **Docs search:** `bl_search_docs` / `bl_api_detail` — the API index is
  introspected from the LIVE Blender over the bridge (`bl_rna` reflection),
  version-matched by construction, cached per version on disk. Live test:
  4,000+ symbols indexed; `shade_smooth_by_angle` found with correct params.
- **Doctor:** real checks (python, uv, Blender binary+version, bridge
  socket round-trip with protocol probe, bpy wheel ABI, Unreal/Epic MCP
  endpoint), each failure with a one-line fix; `--json`; `--emit
  claude-code|claude-desktop|cursor` prints working MCP client configs.
  Evidence: all checks OK on this container with a live bridge (exit 0;
  Unreal correctly a warning).
- **Transport hardening:** oversized-frame rejection completes the
  kill-test set (bridge down / severed mid-response / garbage frame /
  oversized frame — all structured errors, never hangs); advisory
  `.tee/server.pid` notice for double-serve.
- **Tool profiles:** `.tee/config.toml` — `[tools].disabled` (hidden from
  search, calls answer `tool_disabled` naming the config), `[server]
  .allow_code_exec`, `[blender].port`; malformed config degrades with a
  warning in `tee_status`, never bricks the session.
- **Client-compat canaries:** expected-tool-count assertion (catches silent
  catalog drops), every-tool model-visible-content canary, and a real
  stdio-subprocess end-to-end test (spawn `tee serve`, initialize,
  tools/list, tool call through the SDK client).
- Evidence: `uv run pytest` → **107 passed**; `-m dcc` → **22 passed**
  (both bridge flavors); ruff clean; doctor exit 0 with bridge up.

### 2026-08-22 — Phase 7 research + script (cloud)
- Deep-research pass for TEE Extract (9 agents, ~865K tokens): corpus
  digests 11–18 committed; decisions A8–A10 recorded.
- Load-bearing findings: MCP sampling is dead (deprecated in the MCP
  2026-07-28 spec, unimplemented in Claude Code/Desktop) → in-band
  extraction is the default channel; PyMuPDF (AGPL) and all open floor-plan
  ML models (CC BY-NC / GPL) are license-banned → deterministic lane on
  pdfplumber/ezdxf/ifcopenshell/OpenCV; `ezdxf` DIMENSION.get_measurement()
  is dimensional ground truth; images bill by rendered dimensions
  (`ceil(w/28)×ceil(h/28)`, ≤4,784 tokens on the Fable/Opus-5 tier) so
  media serving is token-budget-first; VLM accuracy on drawings is ~0.95
  for text transcription but 0.40–0.55 for symbol counting → extract text,
  verify geometry deterministically; FML v3 adopted as plan-schema base but
  extended (per-level heights, parametric roof) before freeze; frames +
  transforms-as-facts with tier precedence settle cross-source conformance.
- Phase 7 written into `CLAUDE_EXECUTION_SCRIPT.md` (sections 7.1–7.8 with
  acceptance criteria); build not started.

### 2026-08-22 — Phase 7 build (cloud)
- **Store (7.1):** content-addressed fact store under `.tee/extract/`
  keyed (media_hash, extractor, version) with 2-char fanout; re-ingest of
  identical media is a no-op (verified: second ingest of the 7-file fixture
  folder reports ≥6 cached, 0 re-extracted). Evidence-tier table
  `TIER_TOLERANCE_M` with RSS tolerance math; license lint test bans
  fitz/pymupdf/marker/ultralytics imports repo-wide.
- **Plan schema + frames (7.2):** `tee-plan/1` (FML-derived, per-level
  heights, parametric roof, validation with exact-fix errors); frame
  registry with single-active-parent transform tree anchored at `site:enu`,
  Umeyama similarity fit (scale pinned when dimension_text governs,
  free-scale conflict >2% surfaces `units_conflict`), pymap3d geodetic
  datum. All covered by unit tests.
- **Document lane (7.3):** ezdxf DIMENSION ground truth + $INSUNITS
  firewall (unitless DXF → calibration question, never a guess), WALLS/
  ROOMS/DOORS layer extraction to plan facts; pdfplumber vector-sheet lane
  (dimension-string↔line pairing, least-squares scale fit, wall pairing,
  NCS sheet classifier), OCR fallback for scanned pages; fixture DXF and
  PDF plans extract to correct 8m×6m plans (walls, rooms, door, dims).
- **Image/video/audio lanes (7.4):** EXIF+GPS+phash image facts, ≤5-photo
  dedupe groups + labeled contact sheet, token-budgeted `tee_media` serving
  (crop/timestamp/page, patch-formula budget, 4,784 cap); video keyframe
  funnel (2s sampling → sharpness → phash clusters → ≤15 keyframes with
  timestamp index + frame-accurate re-fetch), DJI SRT flight paths
  downsampled to turning points; faster-whisper transcription with VAD
  (fixture: espeak-synthesized brief transcribed, "bedroom"/"budget"
  requirements recoverable), optional HF-gated diarization degrades silently.
- **VLM passes (7.5):** in-band driver (ex_prepare packet: paths, guidance
  per media type, plan-schema hint; ex_store_facts validated writeback) as
  default; optional ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ApiDriver; tile plan respects both
  the 4,784-token and 2,000-px caps.
- **Kernel wiring (7.6):** `ex_*` virtual tools via progressive disclosure;
  `tee_media` is the 15th always-loaded tool; ingest runs as async jobs;
  canaries updated (tool count, model-visible content).
- **Handoff + conformance (7.7):** plan → typed batch ops (rotated unit
  cubes, floor slabs) through the normal checkpointed batch machinery;
  build manifest maps wall ids → entity ids; `bl_check_against_plan`
  compares in the common frame with RSS(tier, tier, chain) tolerance and
  stores over-tolerance deltas as conflict facts. IFC4 export via
  ifcopenshell authoring API (real IfcWall entities, storey elevations).
- **Live acceptance (7.7):** DXF fixture plan built in real headless
  Blender via BOTH bridge flavors: 5 walls + slab, honest build conformant
  (0 conflicts); a wall deliberately moved 0.1 m yields exactly one
  conflict fact naming `plan:w1:position`, delta 0.1 m vs tolerance
  0.017 m, stored in the fact store. Found and fixed a real kernel bug en
  route: `obj.dimensions` writes/reads against a stale bound_box for
  meshes built in the same batch — batch details are now collected after
  one `view_layer.update()`, and dimension props apply scale from true
  vertex extents.
- **Benchmark (7.8):** extraction scenario added to `benchmarks/` — naive
  re-attach of the media set every session vs ingest-once + compact fact
  queries over a simulated 4-session build: **65,176 → 4,811 tokens
  (92.6% saved)**; Blender scenarios re-run and unchanged (87.7% total).
- Evidence: `uv run pytest` → **144 passed, 0 skipped**; `uv run pytest -m
  dcc` → **26 passed** (both bridge flavors, live Blender 5.2); `ruff
  check`/`format` clean; full benchmark suite re-run against live Blender.
